# FASHION FIRM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## About the Company
ATANIA CREATION is a fashion firm that specializes in computerized and hand embroidery. The company's unique approach to creativity, stitching, and sewing has captured the hearts of buyers, and its products are always worth the price.

## About the Project
This project is a C++ based programming application for ATANIA CREATION. The application will allow the company to manage its orders, inventory, and customer data more efficiently. It will also allow customers to place orders online and track their orders in real time.

### Application View Modes
1. Admin View
Admins will have access to enter, view, modify, search, and calculate the details of employees, buyers, designs, and orders. All of this data is password-encrypted for security purposes. The password-encryption ensures that all data is secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized users. This helps to protect the company's data and the privacy of its employees, buyers, designs, and orders.

2. Client View
Buyers will only have access to view the types of work that are provided by the company. If they wish to place an order, they can contact the Admin. The Admin will be responsible for processing all orders and ensuring that they are completed in a timely and efficient manner.
